I have been haggling with cable companies for years so I thought I would explain some of the tricks I have learned to help you lower your cable and internet bill from AT&T. First understand you will be on the phone for a while as you work through the cable company's representatives. So be in a comfortable place where you can discuss money.

Call the company (to reach a person at AT&T call 1-866-746-4714 which will get you directly to a customer representative). Explain that you feel your bill is too high and you need their help lowering it. You may want to reference a recent price hike if you have had one. See of you can get any concessions from the first level support. You are probably not going to get much because they are sales but when they won't negotiate any further ask for retention (sometimes called level two support). Once they have transferred you, explain again that your bill is too high and you need their help to lower it. It's important to be courteous but firm. If you lose your temper you are not going to have a very helpful representative. Remember they spend their day getting fussed at so being nice can set you apart. But it is important to be firm with what you want. Keep using the phrase 'that's not acceptable'. It is important to know what price you want from the company. A good way to get an idea of the lowest possible price is to visit <a href="/about-the-app.html" target="_blank">our crowdsourcing app</a>. There you can find out what other people in your area are paying.

The retention specialist will be the person who can offer you the best deals. Keep telling them you need a lower price until you reach the price point you want. Tell them your friend is paying less and give them an example (from <a href="/about-the-app.html" target="_blank">our crowdsourcing app</a>).  Ask if there are bundles that might lower your bill (in my last discussion with them they were able to lower the cost by adding a phone line) or other services you can add. Tell them you are considering switching to TWC or Google if they are not able to lower your bill. They will offer to give you more services for 'free' but this is just a ploy to get you to pay more later but if you are willing to call back when the trial period is over then accept the offer and remember to call them back to cancel. If they are not willing to meet the price you want to pay be prepared to cancel your service. They will transfer you to the cancellation department who will sometimes offer you a better deal to stay. If not then tell then to turn off your service in two weeks and many times they will call you back with an offer. I did this many times but finally decided to cut the cord. I will write further about that in another blog.
