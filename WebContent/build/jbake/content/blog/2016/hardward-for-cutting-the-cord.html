When you are using cable TV they supply you with all the hardware you need but you pay for it in your monthly bill. Once you have made the decision to save money by cutting the cord you have to make some decisions on what hardware you need but might not be sure where to start or what to buy. Here is a guide on what your cord cutting hardware options are. You are going to have to purchase the hardware (as oppose dto renting it from the cable company) so it is important to make sure you buy purchase the right device. First thing you will need is a high speed internet connection. If you are streaming several devices you will need 50 Mb or more download speed. Second, you will need a device that will allow you to stream shows through the internet. There are many options so here are several and what they can do for you. To help you make a decision on streaming services <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/the-best-internet-video-streaming-services" target="_blank">read this article.</a>

Here are the most popular hardware options.
</p>

<p>
FireTV/Firestick - These are Amazon products so if you are an Amazon Prime member it is a no brainer. However, if you are not a Prime Member don't rule this option out. It is android based so it can run all of the android apps but you may have to sideload some of the apps (like Kodi). You can run all of the major services including Netflix, Amazon Prime, PS Vue, Sling, DirectTV Now, Crackle, WatchESPN, FoxSports, etc. The interface is great. The Firestick is inexpensive at $40 but the FireTV at $80 is much quicker and more responsive. <a href="https://youtu.be/IAVuY6C2RGU" target="_blank">Here is a video of FireTv showing the base interface as well as PS Vue.</a>

Roku - This is one of the original streaming devices. It has all of the major services including Netflix, Amazon Prime, PS Vue, Sling, DirectTV Now, Crackle, WatchESPN, FoxSports, etc. It is not android based which means it cannot run Kodi. The interface is not as good as some other devices. There are several lines of varying prices and performances running from $30 to $90. The more higher priced devices have faster processors and more memory. <a href="https://www.roku.com/products/compare#sku=4620R" target="_blank">Here are the prices and specs for Roku.</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNX0QzJRteE" target="_blank">Here is a video of PS Vue on the Roku device.</a>

<p>
AppleTV - This device is best for those invested in the Apple environment. It has all of the major services including Netflix, Amazon Prime, PS Vue, Sling, DirectTV Now, WatchESPN, FoxSports, etc. It is iOS based and interfaces very well with other Apple products but is expensive starting at $149. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2idYi4rZCXQ" target="_blank">Here is a video of PS Vue on an AppleTV.</a>
</p>

<p>
Smart TVs - Most TV manufacturers have their own smart TVs. They have their own interfaces and are built into the TV. It is convenient but is usually very limited. You get the more popular services such as Netflix but you don't get the wider selection such as WatchESPN. You will only get the apps the manufacturer decides to add. When I bought my last TV I purposely did not get a smart TV due to the limitations and the added cost (it will add $100+ dollars). Here is an example of what the smart TVs look like. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZE8TjncVBG4" target="_blank">This is the Samsung smart TV.</a>
</p>

<p>
Google Chromecast - This is made by Googe and is android based. It has all of the major services including Netflix, Amazon Prime, PS Vue, Sling, DirectTV Now, WatchESPN, FoxSports, etc. One of the unique features of Chromecast is it can display video from other devices like your phone. It allows you to "cast" these unto the TV screen. The Chromecast is inexpensive at $25. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOGh_pAx4iQ" target="_blank">Here is a video of PS Vue on the Chromecast.</a>
</p>

<p>
Generic Android based streaming boxes - these are readily available from various manufacturers. They are inexpensive and have most if not all of the streaming services. But you have no idea of the quality of the hardware nor do you know if the software will be updated with newer apps and services.

So which of these hardware options should you chose when deciding to cut the cord? It all depends. If you are invested in the Apple architecture then you should purchase an AppleTV. If you are Amazon Prime member or like to watch Kodi then chose the Firestick. If you are neither of these then decide which you like best. Look at the interfaces and pricing and make a decision. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCBDx1sGKw4" target="_blank">Here is a video comparing the devices.</a>
