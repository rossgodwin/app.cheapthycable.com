The antenna is making a comeback. I remember my grandparents house that had a motor that rotated the antenna to get the most channels.

Charter Communications makes the list of "most hated" companies.</a> I think it is a combination of their arrogance and disregard for the customer compounded by their questionable business practices that drives this hatred. Given that cable companies are consolidating I don't see this changing any time soon. There will be less competition for cable services so I believe you will see even more and more cable cutting.
