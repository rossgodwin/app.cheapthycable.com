# [CheapThyCable](https://cheapthycable.rossgodwin.com/login) Application Source Code

Application source code for a crowdsourcing web application that I developed giving participants the ability to see what others were paying for cable and internet in their area with the goal of providing leveraging power in negotiating a lower utility bill. Even though this site is now defunct as a product, it resides under my [personal domain](https://cheapthycable.rossgodwin.com/login).
